# Design Description
Descrption for our design for the system.



Requirements
1. When the app is started, the user is presented with the main menu, which allows the user to (1) enter or edit current job details, (2) enter job offers, (3) adjust the comparison settings, or (4) compare job offers (disabled if no job offers were entered yet[1]).

	**To represent this requirement in the class diagram, this is added as our Menu class where we have 4 operations(enter job offer, adjust comparison, compare offers, edit/add job details).**

  
2. When choosing to enter current job details, a user will:
   1. Be shown a user interface to enter (if it is the first time) or edit all of the details of their current job, which consist of:
      1. Title
      2. Company
      3. Location (entered as city and state)
      4. Cost of living in the location (expressed as an index)
      5. Yearly salary
      6. Yearly bonus
      7. Allowed weekly telework days (expressed as the number of days per week allowed for remote work, inclusively between 0 and 5)
      8. Leave time (vacation days and holiday and/or sick leave, as a single overall number of days)
      9. Gym membership allowance ($0 to $500 annually)
   2. Be able to either save the job details or cancel and exit without saving, returning in both cases to the main menu.

	**To represent this requirement in the class diagram, We have a class called "Job" that contains the all the information that will be shared between this requirement and our next requirement.  Our class "Details" is what has the operations we need to save the details, or to cancel adding the details**


3. When choosing to enter job offers, a user will:
   1. Be shown a user interface to enter all of the details of the offer, which are the same ones listed above for the current job.
   2. Be able to either save the job offer details or cancel.
   3. Be able to (1) enter another offer, (2) return to the main menu, or (3) compare the offer (if they saved it) with the current job details (if present).

	**To represent this requirement in the class diagram, We have a class called "Job" that contains the all the information that is shared between the current job and job offers.  The "Offer" class contains operations specific to the requirement.**

4. When adjusting the comparison settings, the user can assign integer weights to:
   1. Yearly salary
   2. Yearly bonus
   3. Allowed weekly telework days
   4. Leave time
   5. Gym membership allowance
If no weights are assigned, all factors are considered equal.

	**To represent this requirement we have created an association class called "comparison" which contains the weight to be applied to each of the above values.  There is also an operation in this class as well to apply our weight**


5. When choosing to compare job offers, a user will:
   1. Be shown a list of job offers, displayed as Title and Company, ranked from best to worst (see below for details), and including the current job (if present), clearly indicated.
   2. Select two jobs to compare and trigger the comparison.
   3. Be shown a table comparing the two jobs, displaying, for each job:
      1. Title
      2. Company
      3. Location 
      4. Yearly salary adjusted for cost of living
      5. Yearly bonus adjusted for cost of living
      6. Allowed weekly telework days
      7. Leave time
      8. Gym Membership Allowance
   4. Be offered to perform another comparison or go back to the main menu.

	**To represent this requirement we have add a rank attribute to the class "Offer" so each offer has a rank based user.  For Steps 2-4 that is not shown in the uml as those are more specific to implementation.**

6. When ranking jobs, a jobâ€™s score is computed as the weighted sum of:

AYS + AYB + GYM + (LT * AYS / 260) - ((260 - 52 * RWT) * (AYS / 260) / 8)

where:
AYS = yearly salary adjusted for cost of living
AYB = yearly bonus adjusted for cost of living
GYM = Gym Membership Allowance ($0 to $500 annually)
LT = leave time
RWT = telework days per week
The rationale for the RWT subformula is:
   1. value of an employee hour = (AYS / 260) / 8
   2. commute hours per year (assuming a 1-hour/day commute) =
1 * (260 - 52 * RWT)
   3. therefore travel-time cost = (260 - 52 * RWT) * (AYS / 260) / 8


For example, if the weights are 2 for the yearly salary, 2 for Gym Membership, and 1 for all other factors, the score would be computed as:

2/7 * AYS + 1/7 * AYB + 2/7 * GYM + 1/7 * (LT * AYS / 260) - 1/7 * ((260 - 52 * RWT) * (AYS / 260) / 8)

**This is not represented in the design as this is an implementation of calculating a jobs ranking score.**


7. The user interface must be intuitive and responsive.
	
**This is not represented in the design as this is a GUI implementation**

8. For simplicity, you may assume there is a single system running the app (no communication or saving between devices is necessary).

	**This is represented in our design as the overall interaction between classes and their operations**
